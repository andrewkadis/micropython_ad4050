         Analog Devices, Inc. EV-COG-AD4050LZ Application Example

Project Name: Readme_button_press.

Description:
============
  Use the GPIO driver to Toggle LED's when the push buttons are
  pressed on the EV-COG-AD4050LZ.

Overview:
=========
  This example uses the GPIO driver to configure the push buttons (GPIO input)
  and LED's (GPIO output) on the EV-COG-AD4050LZ.   An interrupt is generated by
  the push buttons which executes a callback to toggle the LED's.Pressing BTN1 toggles
  LED-1 while BTN2 toggles LED-2.

User Configuration Macros:
==========================
  None.

Hardware Setup:
===============
  EV-COG-AD4050LZ should be configured with default settings jumper
  settings.  Please refer EV-COG-AD4050LZ Manual for default
  jumper settings.

External connections:
=====================
  None.

How to build and run:
=====================
  Prepare hardware as explained in the Hardware Setup section.
  Build the project, load the executable to ADuCM4050, and run it.

Expected Result:
=================
  Press BTN1 or BTN2 to toggle LED1 and LED2 on the EV-COG-AD4050LZ.
  The example waits for the button press.  If no buttons are pressed, it will timeout after sometime
  and message "All Done!" will be printed.
